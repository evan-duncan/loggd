# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    tagline: a privacy-first journal
    lead: |
      Who wants to digitally journal on the web, but also know that only you can read the journals?
      Yes, even we can't ready your entries. And for free? No way. Loggd offers AES-256 encryption for all
      journals, so you can write where ever you are and not worry about your data. We're also open source, so you
      can verify this yourself.
    offer: What do we offer?
    privacy: Privacy
    privacy_tagline: |
      All journal entries are encrypted. This means only you can decrypt them unless you make the journal public.
    simplicity: Simplicity
    simplicity_tagline: |
      There are no frills here. No markdown, no convoluted journal entry management. Secure your journals. Write.
    call_to_action: Get started creating journals that only you can manage.
